            <p> We designed the cookie just outside Seattle, WA. We planned on making Salmon coffee. It was going to blend the two things Seattle was best know for. Turns out the flavor no matter how gentle the fish flavor was too much. So we settled on cookies next. We think people originally bought them because they were just shaped like salmon. Once people found out they had actual salmon in it people really got into buying it claiming it was something you had to do if you were in Seattle. Overnight, we became a Seattle Insitution
